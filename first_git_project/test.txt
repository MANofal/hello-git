git rm filename -> remove the file if it is in unmodifable(repo) stage(i made commit and didn't make add after it)
git rm --cached filename -> move the file from staged to untrackable stage
git rm -f filename -> force to remove the file even if it was in the staged area

git restore --staged filename -> return the file to the staged area
git restore filename -> run it after above line and the file will be restored to the unmodifable stage

git mv oldFileName newFileName  -> to rename the file and make git track the sae file after changing its name 
				   note:(if we renamed it outside git and then added it git will think you removed the old file and make a new file with the new name)
git mv currentpath\filename newpath\file name -> will move the file to new path and track it's the same file
